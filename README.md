# Job Skill Analysis for Cork

## Introduction

As I am pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at the University College Cork (UCC) this coming fall, I am taking proactive steps to gain insights into the dynamic job market in Cork, Ireland. This project serves as an exploration of the current job landscape, focusing on identifying the vital skills that are in demand for roles related to Data and Business Analysis. While Python undoubtedly forms a strong foundation, my endeavor is to uncover additional sought-after proficiencies that will ensure a competitive skill set.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection

To gain a comprehensive understanding of skill-based demand in Cork, I initiated this project by scraping job description data from Indeed.com. Specifically targeting the data analyst role in Cork, I utilized Selenium for data collection. By applying the same methodology I had used previously for a job listing project, I extracted the relevant information and stored it in a CSV file.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Kaggle

The acquired data was uploaded onto Kaggle for further analysis. After preprocessing the data to make it suitable for exploration, I employed Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques to extract skills from the job description column. Through this process, I unveiled the skills that are prominently in demand within the Cork job market.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed intriguing insights into the most sought-after skills in the Cork job market for Data Analyst roles. While Python is undoubtedly a cornerstone skill, the analysis highlighted other vital proficiencies as well. Among these, "Excel" emerged as the most in-demand skill, followed closely by "SAP" and "SQL."

By delving into the data and leveraging analytical techniques, I have gained a valuable understanding of the skill landscape in Cork, equipping me with valuable insights as I prepare to enter the realm of Business Analytics.
