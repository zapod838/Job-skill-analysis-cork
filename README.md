# Job-skill-analysis-cork

Introduction:

As I prepare to pursue an MS in Business Analytics this upcoming fall @UCC, I'm taking a proactive step towards understanding the job market dynamics in Cork. Through this project, my goal is to explore the current job landscape and identify the essential skills sought after for Data and Business Analyst roles. While Python stands as a cornerstone, I'm keen on uncovering additional in-demand proficiencies to ensure a competitive skill set.
